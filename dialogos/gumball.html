penny your shell is part of your
heritage it comes from your ancestors if
we followed that logic the ancestors
before those ancestors were primates and
yet i've never seen you guys eating each
other's lies oh you think this is funny
then let me tell you a story once upon a
time there was a young peanut girl who
came out of her shell in a dangerous
modern world
and what happened she died
80 years later uh could have been worse
of a common cold because she wasn't
wearing her shell oh please i'll tell
you a story once upon a time there was a
bird who was so backwards that when his
computer had a virus he poured chicken
soup into the dvd tray he was so
backwards that he still watched movies
on vhs in rewind he was so backwards
that when his tablet asked if he wanted
to update he chiseled the words no into
it ah i like that bird sounds like me
well that bird forced his whole family
to stay in their eggs and you know what
happened they
died of boredom the rest of their lives
oh yeah i think i get the moral of your
story exactly he should have let go of
tradition and just let them be
themselves no should have made him wear
two shells
don't you get it that bird is you and
you're oppressing this family i am not
oppressing anyone you're oppressing me i
am not oppressing you i'm just
exercising my authority to force you to
do something you don't want to do that's
the exact definition of oppression i
have a story
once upon a time there was a little
peanut who found a magical hat which was
also a puppy who could play the flute
the end
i'm not going back in my shell and we're
not getting out of ours come on back me
up i don't know the atmosphere is
getting kind of icy wouldn't you say
[Music]
this argument is just not my cup of tea
mainly because i don't like my tea lace
with face melting poison uh i think
maybe you guys need outside help i agree
gumbo you decide shell or no shell i
meant more like professional help you
mean like a counselor yeah or like a
cage fighting referee or something
nonsense i trust you'll make the right
decision for the good of everyone
including you
what are you doing feeling the weight of
this decision
[Music]
you
